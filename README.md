# Head_First_Design_Patterns
This repository is to record the examples for implementing concepts from Head First Design Patterns. Each pattern will be put into a single folder with a example code from the book and two different examples of using the design pattern.

The note is taking in the [GitNote](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MlRul5fSE5X8Tmrrc3C/) to write down the important concept and example of each pattern.
